foo_ws2812
foobar2000 plugin to control WS2812 LEDs via an arduino board

This plugin is designed to read waveform or spectrum data
of the currently playing track, convert this data into
a graphical representation (e.g. spectrum, spectrogram,
oscilloscope) and to transfer this image to
a matrix built of WS2812 LED stripes (aka Neo-pixels).

It is inspired by a software called Glediator
http://www.solderlab.de/index.php/software/glediator
and requires an Arduino board running a sketch taken from
this website
(see http://www.solderlab.de/index.php/downloads/category/4-glediator 
for downloads).
The sketch has been modified to use the Arduino serial lib
to be compatible with an Arduino Micro's Virtual COM Port.


I have just started to get to know the SDK and its functions,
copied a few source files from the foo_sample plugin and created
a very simple basic test driver in foo_ws2812.cpp.
This driver reads spectrum data chunks, converts them into
a simple bargraph diagram and sends the pixel data to the COM
port the arduino is connected to. This task is triggered by a
Windows timer. LEDs are just lit in two shades of white, more
sophisticated coloring scemes are planned of course ;-)

A proper properties page to configure the matrix, COM port,
update interval, colors and other settings is on the TODO list as well.
