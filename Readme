foo_ws2812
foobar2000 plugin to control WS2812 LEDs via an arduino board

This plugin is designed to read waveform or spectrum data
of the currently playing track, convert this data into
a graphical representation (e.g. spectrum, spectrogram,
oscilloscope) and to transfer this image to
a matrix built of WS2812 LED stripes (aka Neo-pixels).

It is inspired by a software called Glediator
http://www.solderlab.de/index.php/software/glediator
and requires an Arduino board running a sketch taken from
this website
(see http://www.solderlab.de/index.php/downloads/category/4-glediator 
for downloads).
The sketch has been modified to use the Arduino serial lib
to be compatible with an Arduino Micro's Virtual COM Port.

The plugin is based on the foo_sample plugin found in the SDK.
